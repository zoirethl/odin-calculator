# Calculator Project

This is my final project in The Odin Project Foundations course, where I’m learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations.

## Features

- The calculator has buttons for each digit (0-9), each of the basic math operators (+, -, *, /), an “Equals” key, a “Clear” key, and a “Backspace” key.
- The calculator can display the input and output of the operations on a screen.
- The calculator can handle decimal numbers, and prevents the user from entering more than one decimal point in a number.
- The calculator can handle multiple operations in a row, and evaluates them from left to right.
- The calculator can handle keyboard input as well as mouse clicks.
- The calculator displays a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by zero.
